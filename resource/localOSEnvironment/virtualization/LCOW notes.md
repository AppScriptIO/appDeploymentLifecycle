Docker for Windows: 
• With LCOW (Linux Containers on Windows, built with LinuxKit), the Docker daemon runs as a Windows process and every time you start a Linux container, Docker launches a minimal Hyper-V hypervisor running a VM with the container processes running on top of it, versus the previous architecture where Hyper-V Linux VM runs a Linux Docker daemon, along with all your containers.
• LCOW Set default platform as linux - https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35303#issuecomment-347687570
• # LCOW slow build issue to take into consideration - https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1771
