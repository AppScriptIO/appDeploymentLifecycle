## Concept/Abstraction visual programming - programming using abstractions in a visual interface.
Naming proposal - just like `abstract syntax tree`, call it `abstract node graph`, `abstract visual programming`


# JS programming concepts grained implementation: 
- JS AST can be saved in a flat structure implemented in relationship graph, allowing reusability of nodes/units.
# General abstractions for visual programming
- A UI element is created for specific server functionality. e.g. each concerete middleware would have a specific UI representation that includes input fields for parameters.
