# Version limits: 
- Node version 12: limited by the required libgit2 version available for WSL 1 Debian 10. Currently the only supported libgit2 version for Debian 10 is version libgit2-27, which limits the node dependency nodegit to 0.25 which works only on node <12.
    - Check frequency for support of libgit2-28 for debian 10 - https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=libgit2
