# **Guide to setting up Windows environment for development**

---

# Linux:

-   Install a secondary Linux OS for recovery purposes. e.g. `Debian` > `Ubuntu` > `Pop OS`
-   Make sure to create a EFI Partition separate from the Windows OS one.

# BIOS:

    - storge management: Use AHCI instead of RAID.
    - Turn on secure boot with custom registered keys.
    - Turn off network boot, and unnecessary secondary OS boots.
    - Use UEFI mode.

# Windows:

Install Windows and make sure the installer creates it's own EFI & Recovery partitions (MSR partition is always installed along side the OS system partition), because in case an EFI already exists, the installer seems to skip creation of Recovery partition and uses the existing EFI partition, which may cause issues in Hibernation mode. - UEFI boot: - if errors appear during boot in case multiple EFI enteries for different OSes are registered - use `dual-boot repair for Windows 10` to fix EFI partition table (Access safe mode from windows recovery menu). - remove UEFI boot of previous insllations - using any BCD editor software (e.g. "visual BCD editor") - Update Windows

# Drivers:

Install drivers and control center for overclocking from pc manufacturer.
Install from CD ROM (ISO), where the following drivers should downloaded and use an updated version: - VGA (NVIDIA) driver - use GeForce Experience NVIDIA update tool instead. (+ signin using a created account stored in KeePass use portable version)
Change profile to use `studio driver` rather than optimized for games.
After installation - enable NVIDIA G-Sync for windowed mode. - for Network use the newer Killer Control Panel with performance suite from official website (instead of Killer control manager) - card E2400 - Intel¬Æ Management Engine Driver - install newer driver. run one of the MSI installars https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/67496/Intel-Management-Engine-Interface-Intel-MEI-

# Hibernation:

    - Test Hibernation mode afte driver and updates installed.
    - Note: Hibernation does not work with Hyper-V feature enable in recent Windows versions. Drivers has nothing to do with hibernation wakeup failure. E.g. using the original Windows flash installer that came with the PC (less that version 18), makes it possible to hibernate even if Hyper-V is enabled.
    Note that checking if hibernation works after turnning off a feature should be done in 2nd restart (as in the first restart the feature will not be turned off completely).

# Windows features to enable:

    - enable windows feature: (Differences between featuers - https://superuser.com/questions/1510172/hyper-v-vs-virtual-machine-platform-vs-windows-hypervisor-platform-settings-in-p)
    	- Windows Subsystem for Linux
    	- Windows Hypervisor Platform (prerequisite of the future WSL2)
    	- Hyper-v feature
    	- Virual Machine Platform (allows desktop environment setup to work in the latest windows release.).
            - Containers.
    	- Windows sandbox (created sandboxed environment to test applications without risking the main Windows OS)
    - enable Developer Mode (enables bash for wsl and other features.)
    - Windows long file path https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-fix-filename-is-too-long-issue-in-windows/

# Install chocolatey pacakge manager and [Install Windows software](./installWindowsSoftwareAndChromiumExtensions.md) with chrome extensions to Brave browser‚úîÔ∏è

    - Afterwards, run `Auroruns` program to disable unneeded update services (e.g. office related).
    - Add to firewall programs to prevent connection to the internet in case required.

# Add software shortcuts to "Start Menu" & Taskbar:

    - taskbar: Explorer, Brave, Chrome Canary, VSCodeInsiders, ConEmu, WindowsTerminal, SmartGit, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft OneNote, Fiddler, Postman, StickyNotes, Email, Alarm, IslamicFinder Athan
    - System tray: IslamicFinder Athan, Radio, KeePassXC, docker desktop, bluetooth
    - Windows start menu: Use program "Backup Start Menu Layout v1.3"
        - make sure when saving backup using the program to remove "Info.ini", as it contans personal user data.
        Using terminal doesn't seem to be working (https://www.thewindowsclub.com/import-export-fix-start-menu-layout-windows-10)
        - `export-startlayout ‚Äìpath <path><file name>.xml`
        - `Import-StartLayout ‚ÄìLayoutPath <path><file name>.xml ‚ÄìMountPath C:\`  (%systemdrive% => is the drive where windows is installed)
    - pin shortcuts in the resource > startMenuWindows folder, if they do not exist. (a registry script is used to allow adding any file to the pin start menu).
    - Remove shortcuts from desktop
    - Add Computer folder as a toolbar in taskbar, allowing quick view of filesystem folders.

# üíæ create a restore point for recovery in case the next settings messed up the system:

    - remove unnecessary default windows installed apps before creating a restore point.
    - remove temporary storage files, activity history, recents explorer, before creating a restore point.

# set Settings:

-   Don't require sign-in after wakeup: settings > Accounts > Sign-in options > Require signin.
-   Networking:
    -   Change network workgroup name & computer name (random generated).
    -   turn off network discovery.
-   Run scripts to alter Windwos environment:
    -   Add options to file explorer context menu - _registry script folder_ (./contextMenuRegistryScript).
    -   Use Windows 10 Magnifier - Use lense mode & run on startup minimized https://superuser.com/questions/1097802/start-magnifier-minimized-in-windows-10  
         (shortcuts: Windows with +/- keys https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/84190-open-close-magnifier-windows-10-a.html)
-   Set default apps to use with different file extensions. i.e. Brave, VLC
-   remove unnecessary startup apps and change setting in apps if necessary.
    -   remove `clipboard compare` (Beyond compare product) from startup.
    -   remove unnecessary services from startup (e.g. update services of different apps)
-   Turn on clipboard history - to allow multiple clipboard enteries.
-   Multiple screen setup - resolution, scaling, position, sound source & volume, set primary.
    -   display scale 200% for 4k screen
    -   Ease of Access > Display > make text bigger = 120%, make everything bigger = 200%
        Resource: - Guide to switch between multiple screen modes - https://superuser.com/questions/1322510/switch-between-multiple-displays-configuration-in-windows-10

# Setup Windows & WSL environment: ‚úîÔ∏è

-   WSL2 Entroll into insiders program:
    -   üíæ create a restore point for recovery in case the next settings messed up the system.
    -   Check which Window Insiders release cycle (preview/slow/fast) supports WSL2 (currently slow ring does).
    -   hackish way to enroll into Windows insiders program without an account - https://github.com/myuseringithub/offlineinsiderenroll
    -   switch to WSL2: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install
        -   powershell (administrative privilages) `wsl --set-default-version 2` & `wsl --set-version Debian 2` then verify `wsl --list --verbose`
        -   WSL2 files can be access through path `\\wsl$` (network sharing can be kept disabled)
-   WSL2 related installations: (WSL2 update allows calling wsl commands from windows)
    -   use native docker integrated with WSl2.
-   [WSL1] TODO: setup wslgit which will allow to use a single installation of git on WSL - https://github.com/andy-5/wslgit or https://github.com/hangxingliu/wslgit
-   Download & install distro from Windows store. Lunch the distro and set username & password.
-   Setup development environment using appDeploymentLifecycle repository powershell script.
    -   `yarn run provisionOS` run it through Windows Node's installation, rather than under the newly installed WSL.
        once reached `change default shell` exit the new zsh shell that will be opened to continue installation. Repeat execution if errors occur, and make sure all commands in installations where executed (e.g. powerlevel10K theme in ZSH command group). this command will also update linux `sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`
    -   Make sure the apppDeploymentLifecycle scripts don't mess up some changes made by Docker on WSL2 and VSCode remote server for WSL2. If Issues found try disabling and reenabling docker engine on WSL2 and to trigger reinstallation.
-   Symlink .ssh folder to WSL: `sudo ln -s /<.ssh location>/.ssh ~/.ssh`
    -   git will use 'credential store' (resource > .gitconfig) to lookup for `.git-credentials` file and automatically read token for github. Make sure .git-credentials have the current user as owner and has permissions (-rw-------), instead of root (which will allow usage without sudo),.
    -   TODO: change default path docker lookup for config file (default location `~/.docker/config.json`), to <.ssh folder>/.docker.
-   Setup VSCode in WSL2: ctrl+shift+p and search for "Remote: WSL new window", in which VSCode will download WSL server automatically and set it up.
    -   make sure `code .` or `code-insiders .` works in WSL2 after vscode installed VSCode server in WSL2.
    -   Open extensions tab, and migrate all required extensions to debian side in order to enable them.
        Note: VSCode will have 2 types of extensions UI, & Workspace (requires direct access to source code of projects) extensions. These are installed automatically by VSCode on the correct side - WSL2 server or Windows VScode client.
        VS Code's APIs are designed to automatically run in the right location regardless of where your extension happens to be located.
-   Setup Linux graphical server and Windows client to access WSL2 graphical programs: https://medium.com/@chuckdries/installing-gitkraken-in-wsl-2-15bf6459f823 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL#Running_Graphical_Applications
    -   TODO: [FIX this not working...] Install smartGit graphical program in WSL2 and access it through Windows to take advantage of `inotify` support for autorefresh (as not yet supported), and use wsl own git installation.
        -   (follow steps of above link) Install X server e.g. VcXsrv, symlink configs (from this repo's resource folder), set firewall protocol to allow WSL2 own ip access.
        -   smartgit for linux https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download/#installation-instructions
-   Split repositories between Windows and WSL2: Move most repositories to WSL2 filesystem for greater performance, and keep Window system provisioning and documentation related repositories in Windows.

Notes & Resources:

-   Access root user in WSL2 with `sudo su`
-   An attempt to install WSL2 in insiders program (slow ring):
    -   OS biuld before switching to insiders = 18363.592 (version 1909) or 18363.628
    -   OS build after switching to insiders = 19041.21

<!-- !important: docker desktop engine on WSL2 (unreleased version) still has the following required features not implemented fully: 
    - [Supported ‚úî] Access WSL2 executables from windows: e.g. ` \Windows\System32\wsl.exe git status` in Windows will use the wsl git executable.
    - [Supported ‚úî] /var/run/docker.sock volume still not supported as mentioned in https://www.docker.com/blog/new-docker-desktop-wsl2-backend/ 
    - [Supported ‚úî both host and bridge] WSL2 is now running with a host-only network adapter (While the WSL VM is still on a host-only network adapter, you can access things like docker containers through localhost on your Windows (host) machine) https://medium.com/faun/windows-subsystem-on-linux-wsl-2-first-impressions-96adaf2ebe76
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxhhdo2e-DA
    Use --network="host" in your docker run command, then 127.0.0.1 in your docker container will point to your docker host. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662/from-inside-of-a-docker-container-how-do-i-connect-to-the-localhost-of-the-mach
        The issue is that networking is messed up a little when using docker desktop on WSL2, from what I've observed, docker desktop WSL2 ports are exposed, they do not conflict with localhost but override their access (accessing localhost:8080 will be tranmitted to the WSL2 container, over the host's server/app).
        https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4212
        WSL2 will have it's own ip address https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-ux-changes#accessing-network-applications
        Important note about networking - https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723
        Port exposure when using `--network="host"` in docker run command (e.g. relying on Windows host program like memgraph on host): When host network is used, the container for some reason stops being accessible through eaither WSL2 ip or localhost. Checkout - https://docs.docker.com/network/host/
        WSL2 ip = `ip addr show dev eth0` reveals the address that allows to access the containers ports in the VM.
        host machine ip = `cat /etc/resolv.conf`
        - Accessing WSL2 from Windows can be accessed with localhost.
        - Accessing Windows from WSL2 can be accessed through host machine ip address.
    - [Not supported ‚ùå] iNotify from Windows to WSL2 
        Workaround: move projects to WSL2 filesystem.
